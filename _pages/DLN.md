Today, at 21 years old, I started a new chapter by joining an introductory course in digital humanities. What made it special was the diverse group of classmates from various majors like Computer Science, Interactive Media, Film and New Media, Environmental Studies, Business and Marketing, Literature, and Creative Writing. Each of us brought our own skills and experiences into the mix.
Before diving into digital humanities, we already had some digital skills. As an Interactive Media major, I was into user-centered design and interactive storytelling using software like Adobe Creative Suite. I also did a lot of problem-solving and coding with platforms like GitHub.
My classmates had their own digital toolkits too. The Computer Science folks were coding wizards with Python and Java, while the Film and New Media crew loved making digital stories. Environmental Studies students were into data analysis, and Business and Marketing people knew their way around data analytics. Literature and Creative Writing students were masters at finding stuff in research databases.
But this course changed how we looked at things. We learned that creating digital content wasn't just for one field anymore. We made interactive websites, digital art, immersive stories, and even AI-generated content. Working together showed us how art, science, and storytelling could blend together.
We also got better at working together online using platforms like Slack and Discord. We had cool discussions that mixed up our different areas of knowledge and sparked new ideas. It showed us that collaborating across different fields could make us more creative.
We also got into managing and analyzing research data. We used tools like Zotero and Omeka to organize and share our stuff. Learning about data was important for all of us, no matter our majors.
We also thought a lot about how AI is changing things. Computer Science folks worried about the ethics of AI, while Literature students wondered how AI might affect storytelling. Environmental Studies people saw how AI could help with climate change, and Business and Marketing folks looked at how AI could analyze markets.
Looking ahead, we're excited to keep exploring new ideas and ways of working. We want to mix different fields together and see what happens. We think that working together across different subjects will help us come up with new and better ideas.
So, this course has been a big deal for all of us. It opened our eyes to new possibilities, brought together tech and the humanities, and made us better at understanding digital stuff. We're ready to keep learning and working together, especially as AI keeps changing the world around us.
How do I get started? According to Mattingly, in his blog “[How to Get Started with the Digital Humanities in 2023 and Why](https://medium.com/@wjbmattingly/how-to-get-started-with-the-digital-humanities-in-2023-and-why-baed7b8e1177)", he emphasises the importance of hands-on learning and problem-solving in the field of digital humanities. It encourages individuals to engage in personal projects that address problems they find interesting or relevant to their research. He also suggests that tackling such projects not only helps in building a portfolio but also enhances problem-solving skills and technical expertise. 
Personal projects are seen as opportunities to develop skills incrementally, even if the initial attempts are not perfect. He shares their own experience of creating a complex application despite lacking prior programming knowledge. Perhaps this way highlights the importance of perseverance and learning from mistakes, emphasizing that initial projects serve as learning experiences that can be improved upon over time. 
Furthermore, community support is highly valued within the digital humanities field. It is important to seek help from peers and mentors whenever we need it, highlighting the supportive nature of the community. Additionally, the importance of continuous learning and adaptation is emphasized, as individuals encounter challenges and seek alternative resources to overcome them.
There is also a versatility and transferability of skills learned in digital humanities beyond one's primary field of expertise, which is why I aim to at least keep up with it. These skills broaden one's professional opportunities both within and outside academia.
Furthermore, the blog highlights the dynamic nature of digital humanities, noting its continual evolution due to advancements like machine learning. This evolution creates new opportunities for research and problem-solving, making the field perpetually engaging and relevant. Mattingly encourages us to explore digital humanities as a means to engage with their discipline using modern methods, acknowledging that mastery in this area is an ongoing journey rather than a fixed destination.
This is a bit of a tangent, but my favorite reading in this course thus far is “[Map Power and Map Methodologies for Social Justice](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43773699)” by Shiloh Krupar. He says that with more people making maps, there's a clash between experts and amateurs. Some worry that amateur maps might not be as accurate or reliable as ones made by professionals. This tension shows us that mapping isn't just about drawing lines on a page—it's about who has the power to shape the story.
Another concern is about big companies controlling map data and using it for profit. This raises questions about privacy and who gets to benefit from mapping projects. It's a reminder that not all mapping efforts are equal, and some might serve corporate interests more than the public good.
Krupar suggests that we need to teach "map literacy" in schools and universities. This means not just reading maps but understanding how they're made and what they represent. By doing this, we can learn to use maps as tools for change and challenge the status quo.
In the end, the message is clear: maps aren't just about geography—they're about power and who gets to wield it. By learning about maps and how they work, we can become more informed citizens and advocates for social justice. Mapping as a form of protest and argument also functions as a method of resistance. Throughout history, artists and activists have utilized mapping to defy traditional perspectives and claim authority over their spaces and stories. By crafting alternative maps, they aim to present diverse viewpoints of the world.


## Step 1

As a 21-year-old university student, I embarked on a transformative journey by enrolling in an introductory course in digital humanities. What made this experience particularly enriching was the diverse group of classmates who joined me. Our majors spanned a wide spectrum of disciplines, including Computer Science, Interactive Media, Film and New Media, Environmental Studies, Business and Marketing, Literature, and Creative Writing.
