# Introduction

Many types of vegetables share similarities in color, texture, and shape, and even have different names in different countries. From production to delivery, several steps such as picking and sorting are still performed manually. This makes it challenging for customers to distinguish between similar vegetables at the market. The reliance on manual labor through many stages of vegetable production and consumption significantly hampers the commercialization of vegetable products. 
To address this issue, implementing automation in the processes of picking, sorting, and labeling through a vegetable image classifier is essential, as it would save both time and money. In contemporary agriculture, fundamental research focuses on classification and detection because there are various kinds of vegetables that many people are unfamiliar with. This is why I decided to choose vegetable as the focus of the clustering and classification for this assignment.
I searched Kaggle for an appropriate dataset to work with. I want to work with as big a data set and I am allowed to (in this case being 200 images), so Kaggle seemed the efficient choice in finding all the labelled images I needed in classified folders. I was lucky to find the paper “[DCNN-Based Vegetable Image Classification Using Transfer Learning: A Comparative Study]( https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352846889_DCNN-Based_Vegetable_Image_Classification_Using_Transfer_Learning_A_Comparative_Study)" by Asif Uz Zaman Asif, Mohammed Israk Ahmed, and Shahriyar Mahmud Mamun. The dataset they used for their research was exactly what I needed, and their large dataset provided all the testing images I required. In fact, I had to remove most of the dataset to stay within the 200 images limit.

# Part 1

For the section of the assignment, I collected 20 images of 10 different vegetables, all in one folder to makeup a dataset of 200 images. The vegetables were tomato, radish, pumpkin, potato, cucumber, cauliflower, carrot, capsicum, cabbage, and broccoli.
