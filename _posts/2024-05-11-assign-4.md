# Introduction

Many types of vegetables share similarities in color, texture, and shape, and even have different names in different countries. From production to delivery, several steps such as picking and sorting are still performed manually. This makes it challenging for customers to distinguish between similar vegetables at the market. The reliance on manual labor through many stages of vegetable production and consumption significantly hampers the commercialization of vegetable products. 
To address this issue, implementing automation in the processes of picking, sorting, and labeling through a vegetable image classifier is essential, as it would save both time and money. In contemporary agriculture, fundamental research focuses on classification and detection because there are various kinds of vegetables that many people are unfamiliar with. This is why I decided to choose vegetable as the focus of the clustering and classification for this assignment.
I searched Kaggle for an appropriate dataset to work with. I want to work with as big a data set and I am allowed to (in this case being 200 images), so Kaggle seemed the efficient choice in finding all the labelled images I needed in classified folders. I was lucky to find the paper “[DCNN-Based Vegetable Image Classification Using Transfer Learning: A Comparative Study]( https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352846889_DCNN-Based_Vegetable_Image_Classification_Using_Transfer_Learning_A_Comparative_Study)" by Asif Uz Zaman Asif, Mohammed Israk Ahmed, and Shahriyar Mahmud Mamun. The dataset they used for their research was exactly what I needed, and their large dataset provided all the testing images I required. In fact, I had to remove most of the dataset to stay within the 200 images limit.

# Part 1

For the section of the assignment, I collected 20 images of 10 different vegetables, all in one folder to makeup a dataset of 200 images. The vegetables were tomato, radish, pumpkin, potato, cucumber, cauliflower, carrot, capsicum, cabbage, and broccoli.

Fig 1.1 is image grid created by the inception v3 algorithm that I’ve marked over. I think it did a relatively decent job at organizing the vegetables. On the left are most of the green leafy and the right is populated by all the other colors, but mainly orange vegetables. With this being the cause veg like cabbage, broccoli end up on the left and carrots and potatoes end up on the right. Also visible is a diagonal strip of white veg, consisting of cauliflower and radishes, running across the columns. We can also make out the algorithm has also considered the shape and texture of vegetables. The cylindrical/cone shaped veg (like carrots and radishes) are concentrated in the bottom right of the grid. The more knobbly, cloud shaped veg (like broccoli and cauliflower) are concentrated along the left end of the grid. We can also see a variance in plurality in the grid. The images in the bottom right have many more vegetables in each image compared other images on the grid. This is most probably due to similar shots taken of the carrots, radishes, and cucumbers. To sum up, most vegetables look like they’ve been well within their groups, except for capsicums which are more sparsely spread out near the middle of the grid.
